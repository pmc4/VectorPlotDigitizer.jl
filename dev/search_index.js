The function will detect a bin when two consecutive values of the y axis are not vertical. In such case it will compute the midpoint value of the x axis and take that y axis value.\n\nIf a value of zero_threshold different than 0 is given, then every detected bin with a y value y < zero_threshold will be considered as 0.0.\n\nIf a value of atol is provided, this will be taken as the absolute tolerance in the isapprox method that checks if two points are a straigth vertical line or not. Higher values of atol may give undesired results.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
